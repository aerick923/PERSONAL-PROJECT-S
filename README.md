# PERSONAL-PROJECT-S
This repository contains personal projects that i have constructed during my free time. They help me learn about syntax. I am hoping to create more projects by also exploring other programming languages (HTML/CSS/JS, Java etc.)

personal_project_alba: A simple work-in-progress C++ system that is created for students as a learning management system. It has 4 subjects: Filipino, Math, Science & English. It has a Student Log-in as well as a Teacher Log-in.
